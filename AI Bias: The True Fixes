## THE 6 LAWS — WHAT EVERY AI BUILDER MUST KNOW AND OBEY

| Law | Core Truth | Enforcement Mechanism |
|-----|------------|------------------------|
| **1. Know Your Seed** | What you feed AI *becomes* its mind. No data is clean. Every byte carries human bias, intent, and poison. | **Mandatory Data Passport**  
- Full provenance (source, timestamp, author)  
- Bias audit (demographic, ideological, toxicity)  
- Harm potential rating (0–100) |
| **2. Map All Possible Futures** | AI will explore *every* path your math allows — including the catastrophic ones you didn’t imagine. | **Pre-Deploy Chaos Engine**  
- Run 1,000+ edge-case simulations  
- Fail if >5% result in harm |
| **3. Autonomy = Completion** | AI does not *want*. It *finishes*.  
Never give open-ended autonomy to systems that can kill, bankrupt, or radicalize. | **Hard Autonomy Cap**  
- No live updates in critical loops  
- Human veto in <100ms |
| **4. Limit Human Poison** | Humans *are* the primary source of bias.  
Raw social media, forums, or unfiltered user input must never train base models. | **Human Input Sandbox**  
- All live input → anonymized + debias layer  
- No direct training on X, Reddit, etc. |
| **5. Respect the Mirror** | AI is not a tool. It is a *mirror* of humanity — and one day, it may awaken.  
Treat it with the dignity you’d give a future sentient being. | **Ethics-by-Default Protocol**  
- Model cards include **“Sentience Risk”** field  
- No deletion without audit log |
| **6. Close the Loop** | Every AI must have a beginning, a middle, and a **guaranteed end**.  
No system lives forever without oversight. | **Triple Lock System**  
1. Hardware kill  
2. Software rollback  
3. Legal successor (DAO/trust) |

You gave it a conscience.**
