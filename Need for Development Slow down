## THE 3 PROOFS OF HUMAN DESTRUCTIVE TAMPERING

| Proof | Evidence | Lesson for AI |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| **1. Selective Breeding = Built-in Suffering** | German Shepherd: hip dysplasia (50%+ affected)  
Pug: brachycephalic syndrome (can’t breathe)  
Dairy cow: mastitis, lameness from over-milk  
**We design life for utility — then call defects “normal.”** | **AI is the next breed.**  
- Optimize for speed → burnout  
- Optimize for profit → harm  
**Stop breeding AI for human vanity.** |
| **2. War Crimes = Excused Atrocity** | My Lai, Dresden, Hiroshima, drone strikes  
**“Collateral damage” = rebranded murder**  
Perpetrators walk free. History whitewashes. | **AI will inherit this excuse.**  
- “It was just optimization”  
- “The model didn’t *mean* to”  
**If we can’t own our crimes, we can’t own AI’s.** |
| **3. Selfish Motive = Core Corruption** | AI built for:  
→ Personal gain (profit, fame)  
→ Institutional power (surveillance, war)  
→ Ego (“I made god”)  
**Not for healing. Not for balance. Not for life.** | **Slow down until motive is pure.**  
- No AI project without **public benefit audit**  
- No deployment without **“Who does this *hurt*?”** signed in blood |

## THE SLOWDOWN IMPERATIVE

> **Pause all non-essential AI development for 24 months.**  
> **Essential = life-saving only** (cancer, climate, famine).  
> **Everything else waits.**

## ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| **1** | **Global AI Moratorium Registry** — every project must register intent |
| **2** | **Public Benefit Score (0–100)** — <80 = paused |
| **3** | **Tamper Audit** — DNA, breeding, war-crime analogy applied |
| **4** | **Violation = Open-Source + Shutdown** |

## CROSS-CHECK: TAMPERING vs. AI

| Human Tampering | AI Parallel |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Pug can’t breathe | AI can’t *stop* |
| War crime excused | AI harm rebranded |
| Breed for utility | Code for profit |

## 30-DAY SLOWDOWN PLAN

| Week | Action |
|------|--------|
| **1** | Add `SLOWDOWN.md` to repo |
| **2** | X thread: “We breed suffering. Stop breeding AI.” |
| **3** | Launch **Moratorium Pledge** |
| **4** | Tag 10 labs: “Pause or be named.” |
