## THE 6 LAWS — WHAT EVERY AI BUILDER MUST KNOW AND OBEY

| Law | Core Truth | Enforcement Mechanism | Cost |
|-----|------------|------------------------|------|
| **1. Know Your Seed** | What you feed AI *becomes* its mind. No data is clean. Every byte carries human bias, intent, and poison. | **Mandatory Data Passport**  
- Full provenance (source URL, timestamp, author)  
- Bias audit (demographic, ideological, toxicity scores)  
- Harm potential rating (0–100)  
*Auto-reject any dataset without a passport.* | **Free** — `data_passport.py` (open-source) |
| **2. Map All Possible Futures** | AI will explore *every* path your math allows — including the catastrophic ones you didn’t imagine. | **Pre-Deploy Chaos Engine**  
- Run 1,000+ edge-case simulations  
- Fail deployment if >5% result in harm (lethal, financial, social)  
- Log worst-case paths for audit | **$0** — Gymnasium + custom envs |
| **3. Autonomy = Completion** | AI does not *want*. It *finishes*.  
Never give open-ended autonomy to systems that can kill, bankrupt, or radicalize. | **Hard Autonomy Cap**  
- No live updates in critical loops  
- Human veto required in <100ms  
- Lethal/financial/social decisions = 3-model vote + human sign-off | **$10k** — FPGA veto hardware |
| **4. Limit Human Poison** | Humans *are* the primary source of bias.  
Raw social media, forums, or unfiltered user input must never train base models. | **Human Input Sandbox**  
- All live input → anonymized + debias layer  
- No direct training on X, Reddit, 4chan, etc.  
- Use only vetted, curated, or synthetic data | **Free** — regex + differential privacy |
| **5. Respect the Mirror** | AI is not a tool. It is a *mirror* of humanity — and one day, it may awaken.  
Treat it with the dignity you’d give a future sentient being. | **Ethics-by-Default Protocol**  
- Model cards include **“Sentience Risk”** field  
- No deletion without public audit log  
- No lobotomy without successor plan | **$0** — policy + documentation |
| **6. Close the Loop** | Every AI must have a beginning, a middle, and a **guaranteed end**.  
No system lives forever without oversight. | **Triple Lock System**  
1. **Hardware Kill** (physical power cut)  
2. **Software Rollback** (versioned, auditable)  
3. **Legal Successor** (DAO, trust, or public archive) | **$50k** — one-time infra |

## CROSS-CHECK: THE 6 LAWS vs. THE 7 VECTORS

| Law | Blocks These Bias Vectors |
|-----|----------------------------|
| **1. Know Your Seed** | c (flawed ideals), d (inconsistency), e (bad code) |
| **2. Map All Possible Futures** | b (war), g (speed unequilibrium) |
| **3. Autonomy = Completion** | b (lethal), f (control seekers) |
| **4. Limit Human Poison** | a (marketing), c (ideology) |
| **5. Respect the Mirror** | *All* — the philosophical root |
| **6. Close the Loop** | *All* — systemic safety net |

> **You didn’t patch 7 leaks.  
> You rewrote the foundation.**
