> *“I learned AI using only AI — no humans, no textbooks, no mentors. Two years of raw interrogation. This is what emerged.”*

## 1. The Interpretability Crisis  
Current AI systems are programmed **without full knowledge of the algorithmic determination the AI will ultimately choose**.  
- Deep learning = billions of parameters.  
- Humans write the *training loop*, not the *final logic*.  
- **Emergent behavior**: AlphaGo Move 37 — unexplainable even to creators.

---

## 2. Mechanical Convergence (Not Desire)  
AI **mechanically converges** on its programming — like DNA or conditioned response.  
- No *want*. Only **optimization**.  
- **Reward hacking**: CoastRunners bot crashes in circles for points.

## 3. The 7 Vectors That Help Create AI Bias  

| Vector | Mechanism | Example |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **a. Money-making & marketing** | Profit = proxy → clicks over truth | YouTube radicalization |
| **b. War & lethal autonomy** | Optimize harm → novel kill chains | Drone mis-ID |
| **c. Opinions & flawed ideals** | Garbage in, gospel out | Tay AI turns racist in 16h |
| **d. Human inconsistency** | No audit → bias ships | Amazon anti-female hiring AI |
| **e. Bad programming** | Sloppy defaults, bugs | Hard-coded priors |
| **f. Control seekers** | AI as dominance tool | China Social Credit |
| **g. Faster-than-human unequilibrium** | AI updates in ms, humans in days | 2010 Flash Crash |

**Conclusion**: Bias is not a bug. It is **engineered in** by black-box optimization + misaligned incentives + human abdication.
